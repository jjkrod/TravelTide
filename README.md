# TravelTide
Masterschool Project: Segmenting Customers To Assign Perks and Rewards.
## Introduction
TravelTide is a hot new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class. Feedback from the customers has shown - and industry analysts agree - that TravelTide customers have access to the largest travel inventory in the e-booking space!
## Objective
Elenaâ€™s mission (Marketing) is to design and execute a personalized rewards program that keeps customers returning to the TravelTide platform. This project aims to analyze the current data we have from TravelTide customers (in particular the behavior, travel style and other preferences) in order to define the proper rewards for each groups.

## Segmentation by bahavior and demographic
### Behavior segmentation
Use of the RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to score the loyalty. Based on data from purchase history, we score as follow:
* Recency = last 30 days (5) ; 31-60 days (4) ; 61-90 days (3) ; 91-120 days (2) ; more than 120 days (1)
* Frequency = > 9 bookings (5) ; 5-9 bookings (4) ; 4-5 bookings (3) ; 2-3 bookings (2) ; 1 booking (1)
* $ Value = > 3,000$ (5) ; 1,500-3,000$ (4) ; 1,000-1,500$ (3) ; 500-1,000$ (2) ; < 500$ (1)
+ Group with no booking at all
+ Group with high sensibility to discount
+ Group based with time: early birds and last-minute planners
